## SOCIAL MUSIC APP

### App Description
Tracks what music an individual listens to, and pairs them with others based on that music. Could be potentially used as a dating app, or just meeting new friends with similar music tastes.

### General App Attributes
- **Category:** Social Networking / Music
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users music choices, and connects them to other users with similar choices. The user can then decide to message this person and befriend them if wanted.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with pairing people based on music taste, then perhaps this could evolve into a music sharing application as well to broaden its usage. Large potential for use with spotify, apple music, or other music streaming applications.

### User Stories
1. User logs into our app and chooses how specific his/her music tastes want to be. Start off with genre, artist, song (similar to Pandora), and then get matched with people who share the same interests. You only have the duration of the song to connect with the person, so time is of the essence! If you are a match, you can continue your conversation afterwards.
