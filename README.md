## SOCIAL MUSIC APP

### App Description
// TODO: Tracks what music an individual listens to, and pairs them with others based on that music. Could be potentially used as a dating app, or just meeting new friends with similar music tastes.

### App Idea Evaluation
* Category: Social Networking / Music
* Mobile: This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
* Story: Analyzes users music choices, and connects them to other users with similar choices. The user can then decide to message this person and befriend them if wanted.
* Market: Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be organized into age groups.
* Habit: This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
* Scope: First we would start with pairing people based on music taste, then perhaps this could evolve into a music sharing application as well to broaden its usage. Large potential for use with spotify, apple music, or other music streaming applications.
